### Protocol

M^0 is an EVM-compatible, immutable protocol that enables minting and burning of the ERC20 token $M. It also allows for $M distributions to yield earners and governance token ($ZERO) holders. There are three main types of actors in the protocol - Minters, Validators, and Yield Earners - all of which are permissioned via governance. Protocol variables are also managed by governance and are stored in a Registrar configuration contract.

### TTG

A TTG, "Two Token Governance" is a governance mechanism that uses token voting to maintain lists and manage communal property. As its name implies, it primarily optimizes for token holder participation. A TTG is primarily used for permissioning actors and should not be used for funding/financing decisions.
